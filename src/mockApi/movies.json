    "synopsis": "Based on the worldwide best-selling novel by Simon Winchester, THE PROFESSOR AND THE MADMAN is an extraordinary true tale of madness, genius, and obsession about two remarkable men who created history with the writing of the Oxford English Dictionary. The compilation of the Oxford English Dictionary began in 1857 and was one of the most ambitious, and revolutionary projects ever undertaken. Professor James Murray (Mel Gibson) took on the challenge of creating the most comprehensive dictionary ever compiled, but knew that it would take him and his team over a century to compile all known definitions. However, by \"crowd sourcing\" the work, that is, by enlisting definitions from people all over the world, the dictionary could be compiled in mere decades. As definitions were collected, the overseeing committee, led by Professor Murray, discovered that one man, Dr. W.C. Minor (Sean Penn), had submitted more than ten thousand words. When the committee insisted on honoring him, a shocking truth came to light: Dr. Minor, an American Civil War veteran, was a convicted murderer and being held at an asylum for the criminally insane.",

A journey to relate becomes a journey of rediscovery that forces these women to redefine their relationships with their children, friends, spouses and most importantly, themselves.

Family weddings, cute babies, adorable puppies, and, yes, romance are all fraught with peril in Charlie's carefully managed world. But when the beautiful, spontaneous Francesca (Morena Baccarin) falls for him, the risk-averse Charlie finds himself at a crossroads: suppress his feelings of attraction, or take a chance and let love in?

Ivan is an art thief. He inherited his father's life of crime, but unlike most thieves, Ivan loves the art as much as the art of the steal. More than that, he longs to break free from the criminal world. Ivan's problem is that he's in so deep he may never get out of the devil's bargain he made with a vain and sadistic crime boss. That is until he meets Elyse, an actress and a con-woman with her own chaotic past she wants to escape from. Together, they team up to pull off the ultimate con/heist which won't make them rich, but will hopefully set them free.",

At the show, Seth and Jameson's friends are too caught up in their own lives to be much help: young rocker Taylor romances his new crush Dana, and awkward Jack \"Rabbit\" avoids his childhood friend Lexi after learning what she did at her sister's wedding. These intertwining friend-dramas, fueled by a lot of drinking, unfold against a backdrop of live music performed by the best bands in town. By the end of the night, these young men and women are confronted with a series of fast- approaching life decisions that will either leave them stuck in the comfort of adolescence, or catapult them into adulthood.",

Having late night snacks and watching television are an integral part of their dull lives. One day when the television is broken, their lives are changed forever. At first, they watch the footages recorded on their boss's dash cam for fun, and soon they get addicted to peeping into the boss's colorful private life and accidently discover the boss's unspeakable secret. As a result, a ridiculous chain reaction is triggered, and even the statue of Buddha, ready to be sent to the religious festival, is forced to play a role in this chaotic situation. The story involves gods, the middle-aged men's sexual desire and the conversation between ghosts and humans. Maybe the audience will find it preposterous, but isn't life itself a farce?",

It's a five-borough journey that stretches from the barbershops of the Bronx to the forests of Staten Island, from the Statue of Liberty to Times Square, with Matt amassing a surprisingly detailed knowledge of New York's history and people along the way. Something of a modern-day Thoreau, Matt gave up his former engineering job, his apartment, and most of his possessions, sustaining his endeavor through couch-surfing, cat-sitting and a $15-per-day budget. He's not sure exactly why he's doing it, only knowing that there's no other way he'd rather spend his days. Executive produced by Oscar (R) nominee Jesse Eisenberg, The World Before Your Feet is a tribute to an endlessly fascinating city and the freedom to be found, wherever you live, in simply taking a walk.",

The promise of a boat never materializes leading one of the sailors to question why people had abandoned the island. Through his investigation he discovers that every year around the same date a tragedy at sea would occur and young men from the island would perish. When his two shipmates meet with fatal accidents, the myth of a ghostly siren haunting the island leads him to try and uncover the truth.",

But when their sensuous, non-traditional surrogate arrives (Anna Camp, Pitch Perfect) the truth comes out, and the patriarchy fights to hang on by its teeth.",

Can a proud 400-year-old whaling tradition survive a tsunami of modern animal-rights activism and colliding forces of globalism vs. localism? A WHALE OF A TALE reveals the complex story behind the ongoing debate. Told through a wide range of characters including local fishermen, international activists and an American journalist (and long time Japanese resident), this powerful documentary unearths a deep divide in eastern and western thought about nature and wildlife and cultural sensitivity in the face of global activism.",

The pair drop their pants and quickly thereafter Sam drops his emotional guard. They develop an intergenerational relationship that reawakens Sam's artistic soul and revives his wilted heart. Beyond the evocative performances and setting, AFTER LOUIE is a love letter to New York City: engaging its rich backdrop, while honoring the history of the gay rights movement and the progress that's been made. Amid the arguments over politics, loss, aging, white privilege and the dark side of gay sexuality, AFTER LOUIE offers up a pervasively wicked sense of humor and a big, generous, survivor's heart.",

    "synopsis": "CITY OF JOY tells the story of the first class of girls at a remarkable center in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Directed by first time director, Madeleine Gavin, it tells of the visionaries who imagined a revolutionary place where women who have suffered horrific rape and abuse, learn to lead amidst a war driven by greed, economics and colonialism. The film shares the unlikely friendship that develops when a devout Congolese doctor, Dr. Denis Mukwege, (2016 Nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize), radical playwright and activist, Eve Ensler, (Tony Award winning playwright of The Vagina Monologue) and a charismatic Congolese human rights activist, Christine Schuler-Deschryver, (Director of the City of Joy) join forces to create this safe haven in the middle of violence-torn Eastern Congo, a place they call The City of Joy. And it is the story of the incomprehensible power of the human spirit as we witness our characters' discovery of hope, even when so much of what was meaningful to them has long been stripped away.",

    "synopsis": "What happens when you throw together a fallen Mexican wrestler with serious rage issues, a just-out-of-prison ex-con with a regrettable face tattoo, and a recovering junkie motel owner in search of a kidney? That's the premise of the berserk, blood-spattered, and wickedly entertaining feature debut from Ryan Prows. Set amidst the seedy underbelly of Los Angeles, Lowlife zigzags back and forth in time as it charts how fate-and a ruthless crime boss-connects three down-and-out reprobates mixed up in an organ harvesting scheme that goes from bad to worse to off-the-rails insane. Careening from savagely funny to just plain savage to unexpectedly heartfelt, this audacious thriller serves up nonstop adrenaline alongside hard-hitting commentary about the state of contemporary America.",

    "synopsis": "In this gorgeously animated drama, the lives of several strong-willed women and a young musician intersect. Their stories reveal the hypocrisies of modern Iranian society, where sex, drugs, and corruption coexist with strict religious law. In the bustling metropolis of Tehran, avoiding prohibitions has become an everyday sport and breaking taboos can be a means of personal emancipation. Nevertheless, women invariably end up on the bottom rung of the social order. A young woman needs an operation to \"restore\" her virginity. A judge in the Islamic Revolutionary Court exhorts favors from a prostitute in exchange for a favorable ruling. The wife of an imprisoned drug addict is denied the divorce she needs in order to live independently. Making use of rotoscope animation, expat Iranian filmmaker Ali Soozandeh creates a portrait of contemporary Tehran that would be impossible by any other means.",

The gripping true crime tale KILLING FOR LOVE untangles the web of romantic obsession and betrayal that may have led an innocent man to make the ultimate sacrifice for love: take the fall for a murder he didn't commit.

    "synopsis": "The year is 2020, three days before the opening of the Tokyo Olympics. While she should be studying for her exams, Kokone Morikawa is often dozing off, stuck between reality and a dream-world full of fantastic motorized contraptions. But after her father, a talented but mysterious mechanic, is arrested for stealing technology from a powerful corporation, it's up to Kokone and her childhood friend Morio to save him. Together they realize that Kokone's dream-world holds the answers to the mystery behind the stolen tech, and they embark on a journey that traverses dreams and reality, city and country, and past and present. Their mission uncovers a trail of clues to her father's disappearance and ultimately a surprising revelation about Kokone's family. From visionary director Kenji Kamiyama (Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex and Eden of the East) comes a sci-fi fantasy that effortlessly weaves together the rapidly evolving technology of today's world with the fantastic imagination of the next generation. With an ambitious mix of multilayered action, whimsical characters and inventive machines, Napping Princess is a genre- and universe-blending film that shows that following your dreams is sometimes the best way to discover your past.",

Fists (and bullets, tanks, missiles and much more) will fly in this adrenaline-fueled tour de force of bravura action filmmaking, all culminating into a climatic battle between the Wolf Warrior and the mercenary leader (Frank Grillo, Captain America: The Winter Solider and Captain America: Civil War).",

    "synopsis": "On a seemingly ordinary night in Paris, Pierre takes one last look his lover Paul's sleeping body, then takes off into the early morning light. Where he's headed, neither of them know. Pierre's only guide is his Grindr app, which leads him on a series of encounters with an indelible cast of characters across the French countryside. Paul sets out after him, using his own phone to track Pierre's movements in a strange and wonderful game of Grindr cat-and-mouse. J√©r√¥me Reybaud's assured feature debut is \"an erotic road movie like no other\" (Film Society of Lincoln Center) and an \"ode to cruising writ large\" (Slant). It's a tale imbued with sensuality, humor and surprising tenderness. Sumptuously shot by Sabine Lancelin (Rohmer's Boyfriends and Girlfriends, Oliveira's The Strange Case of Angelica) and featuring a supporting a cast of familiar faces from French cinema, 4 Days in France offers a sophisticated take on gay romance in the 21st century.",

    "synopsis": "It's 2015, seventeen years after Peggy tripped over G.W.'s wooden legs and died in Sordid Lives, and life has moved into the present for the residents of Winters, Texas. Sissy Hickey (Dale Dickey) is reading the Bible, cover to cover, trying to make some kind of sense out of what it really says about gay people. Her niece Latrelle Williamson (Bonnie Bedelia) has divorced her husband Wilson (Michael MacRae) who has taken up with a hot young gold digger (Katherine Bailess). Latrelle's now out and proud gay son Ty (Kirk Geiger) is on his way back to town with his black man (T. Ashanti Mozelle) and news of their own. Her sister LaVonda (Ann Walker) is still cussin' and drankin' and is being blackmailed to sit with the sick and afflicted. LaVonda's best friend Noleta (Caroline Rhea) meets a hot younger man (Aleks Paunovic) while visiting her awful mama (Carole Cook) in the hospital. G.W. (David Steen), sporting new fiberglass legs after Noleta burned his old ones, is still feeling guilty and mourning Peggy. Nearly incoherent barfly Juanita (Sarah Hunley) has moved from her obsession with Vacation Bible School roosters to the royal family while Wardell (Newell Alexander) and Odell (David Cowgill) still bicker at the bar. Tammy Wynette champion Brother Boy (Leslie Jordan) hasn't been back to Winters since Peggy's funeral, and he's working at a tragic little gay bar in Longview, having added Loretta and Dolly to his new medley act \"We Three Queens of Oper-y Are\" till a chance meeting with a dangerous criminal (Emerson Collins) forces him out on the run. Again. As the sordid saga continues, an anniversary memorial service is being planned in honor of Peggy at Bubba's Bar while the Southside Baptist Church is planning an \"Anti-Equality Rally\" to protest the advancement of same-sex marriage, spearheaded by Vera Lisso (Lorna Scott) and Mrs. Barnes (Sharon Garrison.) Both events are to take place on the same night, so the cast of colorful characters are all on a collision course for shenanigans and fireworks! Along the way a host of new faces arrive in Winters - Ty's man, Latrelle's ex-husband and his gold digger, the new fire and brimstone preacher (Levi Kreis), Noleta's mother, several drag queens and a bisexual serial killer, all swept into the adventure on the way to the surprise wedding. As the original film dealt with coming out in a conservative southern world, A Very Sordid Wedding explores the questions, bigotry and the fallout of what happens when gay marriage comes to communities and families that are not quite ready to accept it. Bigoted \"religious freedom,\" marriage equality and cultural acceptance are all explored with Del Shores' trademark approach to using comedy and his much-beloved Sordid Lives characters to deal with these important current social issues and the very real process of accepting your family for who they are instead of who you want them to be.",

GAGA is a unique documentary experience that tells the story of the internationally acclaimed choreographer Ohad Naharin, who created the daring form of dance and \"movement language\" Gaga. When he was 22, he was invited to perform with the prestigious Martha Graham dance company, and attended Juilliard and the School of American Ballet simultaneously. But Naharin would not be happy until he could do exactly what he wanted. Moving back to Israel, Naharin became the Artistic Director of the Batsheva Dance Company, developing Gaga within his own ensemble. Even after achieving worldwide acclaim, Naharin continues to fight every day, sometimes with his own dancers, once even with the president of Israel, to make his vision come to life. Meeting him at a critical turning point in his personal life, this spirited and insightful documentary will introduce you to a man with great artistic integrity and an extraordinary vision. MR. GAGA tells Naharin's personal story of a controversial, political, and always entertaining figure, and his constant battle for artistic perfection. Eight years in the making, MR. GAGA traces Naharin's artistic roots using personal family footage, intimate rehearsal footage, extensive unseen archive material and stunning dance sequences. Heymann weaves a marvelous tale of what it takes to be a genius, the exhausting toll dance can take on its performers, and finally, the beauty that art can bring to this world.",

    "synopsis": "Eva Hesse (1936-1970) is one of America's foremost postwar artists. Her pioneering sculptures, using latex, fiberglass, and plastics, helped establish the post-minimalist movement. Dying of a brain tumor at age 34, she had a mere decade-long career that, despite its brevity, is dense with complex, intriguing works that defy easy categorization. EVA HESSE, the first feature-length appreciation of her life and work, makes superb use of the artist's voluminous journals, her correspondence with close friend and mentor Sol LeWitt, and contemporary as well as archival interviews with fellow artists (among them, Richard Serra, Robert Mangold, Dan Graham) who recall her passionate, ambitious, tenacious personality. Art critic Arthur Danto has written that her work is: \"full of life, of eros, even of comedy... Each piece vibrates with originality and mischief.\" The documentary captures these qualities, but also the psychic struggles of an artist who, in the downtown New York art scene of the 1960s, was one of the few women to make work that was taken seriously in a field dominated by male pop artists and minimalists. -Karen Cooper, Film Forum",

    "synopsis": "In the Jewish religion, a week of sitting Shiva (or mourning the deceased) is called for after a funeral. However, for Eyal and Vicky, a week is hardly enough time to properly mourn the loss of their 25-year-old son Ronnie. A married couple edging into the back half of middle age, the two find themselves reacting to the end of Shiva in markedly different ways. A return to routine seems to be in order for Vicky, a teacher, as she finds herself back at school trying to abruptly kick out the substitute assigned in her stead. Meanwhile, shopkeeper Eyal opts for a total abdication of routine, as he steals his dead son's bag of medical marijuana, and proceeds to get high, play ping-pong and judge air guitar routines with his neighbor's stoner son Zooler. As the world refuses to accommodate Vicky and Eyal's sensitivities during their time of bereavement -- taxi drivers are still difficult, neighbors are still obnoxious, and grave diggers are just as indifferent as anyone else in the service industry -- the two grieving parents find themselves acting out in outlandish ways as they attempt to regain a sense of control over their lives. Asaph Polonsky's debut feature ONE WEEK AND A DAY juxtaposes the grieving process against the immutable fact that, despite the most painful losses imaginable, the world stops for no one's mourning. With endearing performances from Shai Avivi and Evgenia Dodina as Eyal and Vicky, and Tomer Kapon as Zooler, ONE WEEK AND A DAY provides a nuanced perspective on loss that's as funny as it is insightful.",

    "synopsis": "It was the original Fake News story. In a small New Jersey town on the night of Orson Welles's legendary 1938 \"War of the Worlds\" radio broadcast, the hoax that terrified millions into believing Martians were invading America, citizens face what they think is their last night on Earth. The over-worked town's mayor Clark (Tony Hale, \"Veep\") will take a chance on love. The neglected housewife, Lorraine (Heather Burns, \"Manchester By The Sea\") will break free from her big-cheese husband (Sam Jaeger, \"Parenthood\"). The demure schoolteacher Peg (Anna Camp, \"Pitch Perfect\") will become a warrior. The aimless reverend (Dan Bakkedahl, \"Life in Pieces\") will rediscover his faith. The scared Sheriff (Mel Rodriguez, \"The Last Man on Earth\") will find his courage. And the reclusive war veteran (Raymond J. Barry, \"Training Day\") will become a hero as he convinces the town to fight the aliens. All these characters join forces for a final \"battle\" that leads to a surprising and hilarious outcome. An alien invasion comedy where the aliens never show up.",

Regularly calling into radio talk shows - where he has acquired the nickname \"Buster\" - to rant about the impending Inversion at the turn of the millennium, he is haunted by visions of being lost at sea, and memories of his former life as a family man. Buster (Rami Malek) was once Jonah, a hard-working husband and father whose job as the night-shift concierge at a hotel took its toll on his psyche and, consequently, his marriage to the sensitive Marty (Kate Lyn Sheil) - until a chance encounter with a conspiracy-obsessed drifter (DJ Qualls) changed the course of their lives forever. As the solitary present-day Buster drifts from house to house, eluding the local sheriff at every turn, we gradually piece together the events that fractured his life and left him alone on top of a snowy mountain, or perhaps in a small rowboat in the middle of a vast ocean - or both, in this visceral mind bender that will provoke discussion long after it turns your world upside-down.",

    "synopsis": "During a routine trip to the mall, 15-year-old Jesse's best friend is violently attacked at random. The attackers do not confront or acknowledge Jesse, and Jesse does not engage or pursue the attackers... he simply backs away. Why did this happen? Could Jesse have done more? Did he have an obligation? These are the questions posed by VIOLET, a carefully calibrated character study of the process of coping in the midst of senseless trauma. Jesse's parents and friends all seem to have their own (often destructive) reactions to the incident, but it's the parents of the victim to whom he develops a strange connection. Shot partially on 8-perf 65mm film by acclaimed cinematographer Nicolas Karakatsanis (Bullhead, The Drop), Bas Devos' meticulously calculated debut is constructed like a series of lush photographs. In each of the film's compositions we see a sophisticated mosaic of loss, the permanence of trauma, and the tumult of youth.",

Suspended from his job, Dylan begins to notice the increasingly ominous repetition of sounds and events in his life that happen at exactly the same time everyday. An underlying pattern builds, mysteriously drawing him into Grand Central Station everyday 2:22pm. As he's drawn into a complex relationship with a beautiful woman who works in an art gallery, Sarah (TERESA PALMER), disturbingly complicated by her ex-boyfriend Jonas (SAM REID), Dylan must break the power of the past, and take control of time itself.",
